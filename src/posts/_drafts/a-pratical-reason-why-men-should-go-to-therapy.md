Men don't know how to talk about emotions without being cringey.

We carry a lot of baggage on what it means to be men, and one of them is to be stoic and not talk about our feelings.

One of the reasons why is because talking about our emotions is expected to be cringey.

All anyone knows about talking about their feelings is from films and tv shows, where the characters are endlessly crying and screaming and throwing shit around.

And I think as a society, this is kind of expected of everyone.

Like noone thinks its weird when a girl cries.

In fact, both men and women are sympathetic to crying women.

But for men it's a different story.

If the standard for talking about one's feelings is to act adopt a similar behavior as seen on screen, then guys don't want that.

Because it makes us look weak, and it's not what the guys in all the films do.

## The Results

So on one hand, everyone has grown up with expectations of how one should talk/emote their feelings.

But society only expects one gender to behave accordingly, while the other is left in the dust.

Therefore, going to a therapist is the most practical option.

Not only can it a safe space to say the things we want without being judged (as difficult as it is),
we can also learn how to properly talk about our emotions without referencing fiction.

## Conclusion

This is something I thought of while falling asleep, but I wanted to jot it down before I lost it.

Maybe I'm onto something.

That a guy's only reference to be emotional is to based on Hollywood, which is to cry.

But guys don't cry because it makes us look weak.

And we don't know how to properly talk about our feelings without screaming/crying/shouting/etc. because the only reference we have is films and how male characters behave when the female lead gets emotional.

But since we don't live in a fictional world, talking and behaving like we're in one is cringe.

But that's all guys know.

That's all everybody knows how to act.

But it's only socially acceptable for one gender.
