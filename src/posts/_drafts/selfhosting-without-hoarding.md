As liberating and rewarding self-hosting can be, there's plenty impractical things you can do.

Having a large media library (i.e. terabytes) is one of them.

I understand downloading media that have sentimental value to you is a good way of avoiding Big Media from pulling the rug under you.
It's a preventative measure against entities that don't want you to own anything and be happy.

What I don't understand is the need to have your own Netflix, with discovery and ALL the content available at your fingertips.

<!-- I don't know if this is relevant anymore, but a couple of years ago there was a meme floating around that there's nothing good to watch on Netflix anymore. -->

<!-- If doomscrolling social media is bad, then isn't mindlessly scrolling through Netflix bad as well? --> 
<!-- Especially now in 2025 where every new movie that comes out is either a nostalgic remake or Marvel slop what's the point of having automatic discovery? --> 

<!-- Why would you want to replicate this time-wasting functionality in your own house on your own hardware? -->
