A couple of weeks ago I decided to limit my phone screen time to 4 hrs.

I was spending a bit too much time on my phone than I would like, so I decided to give myself a limit.

### Why 4 hrs?

I think I read in ~~a blog somewhere~~ [Herman's blog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/being-present/) that the average American spends 5 1/2 hrs on their phone.

Me being me, I wanted to be an overachiever and go under the average.

### My daily phone usage

I don't have any social media, so I dont have the accompanying app installed on my phone.

Most of my time is spent on [Hacker News](https://news/ycombinator.com), reading my RSS feed
### Did it work?

This is what my home screen looks like
