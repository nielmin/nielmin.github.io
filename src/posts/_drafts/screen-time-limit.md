A couple of weeks ago I decided to limit my phone screen time to 4 hrs.

I was spending a bit too much time on my phone than I would like, so I decided to give myself a limit.

### Why 4 hrs?

I think I read in ~~a blog somewhere~~ [Herman's blog](https://herman.bearblog.dev/being-present/) that the average American spends 5 1/2 hrs on their phone.

Me being me, I wanted to be an overachiever and go under the average.

### Daily phone usage

I don't have any social media, accounts or apps.
So I don't spend a lot of time on them on my phone (pratically zero).
If I do, it is usually through my browser of choice [IronFox](https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/IronFox).

Most of my time is spent on [Hacker News](https://news/ycombinator.com), my RSS feed, or YouTube.
I don't necessarily mind the time I spend reading something.
Most of what I read can be lazily categorized as "educational".

Personally, I wanted to break the habit of watching YouTube while I'm eating, which is something people my age do regularly. 
I just don't think it's a good thing to do.

### Did it work?

This is what my home screen looks like
