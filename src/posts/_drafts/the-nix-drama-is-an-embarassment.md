title: 'The Nix Situation is an Embarassment to FOSS'

More than ever, being a FOSS developer is tough.

On one side, you have billion-dollar corporations (and now AI) using their work for years on end without giving them a single dime, which has led some to take drastic measures.

And on the other hand, you have entitiled users that want endless amount of features and support for free.
The moment a developer asks for some financial support, they're usually met with accusations of being greedy and/or a shill from their userbase.

Most developers either get fed up or burnt out and turn away from their projects.
They have more than the right to do so.

But there are some developers that, despite these conditions, continue to trudge on and continue to maintain their software, solely for love of programming.
These are the people that we should cherish and support in any way possible.

Which brings me to the latest Nix drama.

## WTF

As stated previously, being an OSS developer is bad as it is with greedy companies and entitled users.
So how the FUCK is it possible for a niche community about a *really cool* package manager and *less cool* language to have countless developers and maintainers to step away from the project due to the **in-fighting** ?!
Seriously, how atrociously **toxic** of a community do you have to be to make an elected member YOU voted for of a governing body that YOU CREATED a year ago STEP AWAY as maintainer of the very project the community is built around?
