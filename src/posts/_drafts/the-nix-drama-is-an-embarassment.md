title: 'The Nix Situation is an Embarassment to FOSS'

More than ever, being a FOSS developer is tough.

On one side, you have billion-dollar corporations (and now AI) using their work for years on end without giving them a single dime, which has led some to take drastic measures.

And on the other hand, you have entitiled users that want endless amount of features and support for free.
The moment a developer asks for some financial support, they're usually met with accusations of being greedy and/or a shill from their userbase.

Most developers either get fed up or burnt out and turn away from their projects.
They have more than the right to do so.

But there are some developers that, despite these conditions, continue to trudge on and continue to maintain their software, solely for love of programming.
These are the people that we should cherish and support in any way possible.

Which brings me to the latest Nix drama.

## WTF

As stated previously, being an OSS developer is bad as it is with greedy companies and entitled users.

So how the FUCK is it possible for a niche community about a *really cool* package manager and *less cool* language to have countless developers and maintainers to step away from the project due to the **in-fighting** ?!

Seriously, how atrociously **toxic** of a community do you have to be to make an elected member YOU voted for of a governing body that YOU CREATED a year ago [STEP AWAY](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/stepping-down-from-the-nix-team/70203) as maintainer of the very project the community is built around?

To add onto the fire, you have community members calling for the early resignation of another elected member.

## But it's justified, right?

Nope.

From what I could gleam, it seems like the crux of the issue is that the Nix Steering Committee (the ones with elected members) banned a member of the Nix Moderation team (un)justifiably.

...

...

...Oh you wanted more?
Like there has to be more to the story than a moderator getting banned and all their mod friends getting upset, mass ["resigning"](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828), and throwing a [hissy](https://web.archive.org/web/20251002091458/https://discourse.nixos.org/t/stepping-down-from-the-nix-team/70203) fit, right?

Nope.
Even with additional [context](https://web.archive.org/web/20251003061345/https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103), it is still as sad and pathetic as you'd believe it to be.

## Internet Moderators

I think it's fair to say most people don't view online moderators favorably.

Unless proven otherwise, these individuals tend to have an over-inflated ego about their role and power trip whenever they can in whatever community they're "janitoring". 
The instant someone questions the greater authority or decision-making of a moderator, they're immediately banned.

Think of Reddit and Discord moderators of today, or forums moderators of the past.
You've all probably had more bad mod interactions than good.

So because of the general reputation moderations have on the greater Internet, I viewed the drama biasly favoring the Steering Committee.

And it seems like I was right to do so.

## Maybe "Democracy" isn' the answer

Because whatever the Nix community has resembles no such thing.

### Humor me

Imagine a democratic country was found to be corrupt since its inception.
After a fierce and intense battle, the citizens, with help from the police, finally arrest the pollticians and exile them from the country.

In order to return to normalcy, the citizens decide to do democracy "right" this time and vote on their officials in proper elections.
The popular ones gets elected, and the people believe that their electorates will lead them to a better future.

But because this is the first time democracy has been done "properly", the new government makes some mistakes despite their best intentions.
They pass laws that don't benefit everyone; they go over the budget; they increase taxes too high.

They just don't listen to the people.

But instead of talking things out like adults, the citizens believe this to be another "corrupt" government and, with the help of the police, arrest and excommunicate their politicians.

Maybe this time, the citizens can do democracy "properly".

But if not, they can always turn to the police for help.

## Conclusion
