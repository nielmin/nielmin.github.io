## Main Desktop

- OS: Fedora 42 KDE
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (6c/12t)
- GPU: XFX RX 6700 XT (12 GB)
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200 MHz (48 GB)

Computer was built over the course of a couple of years.
Upgrades were mostly from Craigslist deals.
Kind of overkill for my needs currently since I do not play AAA titles anymore.

## Laptop

- Model: ThinkPad T480
- OS: NixOS 25.05
- CPU: Intel i5-8250U (4c/8t)
- RAM: 16 GB

### "Upgrades"

- Dual-heatpipe CPU cooler
- Glass trackpad from X1 Carbon
- Chassis

I had a ThinkPad infatuation sometime in the middle of the pandemic.
So I grossly overpaid for a device that with a busted chasis and an imperfect screen.
I had to order a replacement parts from China to fix all these issues.

In hindsight I should've returned the laptop.

But fanboys will do fanboy things.

## Keyboards

I recently bought a broken [TOTEM Wireless](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM) from eBay for _cheap_.
Using my (poor) soldering skills, I managed to fix the broken keys and am currently typing on the board itself.

Previously I was using a [cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) that I built myself, and before that a [Lily58](https://boardsource.xyz/products/lily58) and [Ergohaven Planeta](https://ergohaven.xyz/planeta) V1.
