<p class="post-summary">A realization I had in my self-hosting journey.</p>

<article>
  <p>As liberating and rewarding self-hosting can be, there's plenty impractical things you can do.</p>
<p>Having a large media library (i.e. terabytes) is one of them.</p>
<p>I understand downloading media that have sentimental value to you is a good way of avoiding Big Media from pulling the rug under you.
It's a preventative measure against entities that don't want you to own anything and be happy.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is the need to have your own Netflix, with discovery and ALL the content available at your fingertips.</p>
<!-- ## Nothing good on `$STREAMING_SERVICE` anymore -->
<!-- I don't know if this is relevant anymore, but a couple of years ago there was a meme floating around that there's nothing good to watch on Netflix anymore. -->
<!-- !["Using Netflix be like"](/static/img/posts/2025-09-19/netflix-meme.png "a netflix meme") -->
<!-- If doomscrolling social media is bad, then isn't mindlessly scrolling through Netflix bad as well? --> 
<!-- Especially now in 2025 where every new movie that comes out is either a nostalgic remake or Marvel slop what's the point of having automatic discovery? --> 
<!-- Why would you want to replicate this time-wasting functionality in your own house on your own hardware? -->
<!-- ## Mindful Consumption -->
