  <p>Men don't know how to talk about emotions without being cringey.</p>
<p>We carry a lot of baggage on what it means to be men, and one of them is to be stoic and not talk about our feelings.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why is because talking about our emotions is expected to be cringey.</p>
<p>All anyone knows about talking about their feelings is from films and tv shows, where the characters are endlessly crying and screaming and throwing shit around.</p>
<p>And I think as a society, this is kind of expected of everyone.</p>
<p>Like noone thinks its weird when a girl cries.</p>
<p>In fact, both men and women are sympathetic to crying women.</p>
<p>But for men it's a different story.</p>
<p>If the standard for talking about one's feelings is to act adopt a similar behavior as seen on screen, then guys don't want that.</p>
<p>Because it makes us look weak, and it's not what the guys in all the films do.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>So on one hand, everyone has grown up with expectations of how one should talk/emote their feelings.</p>
<p>But society only expects one gender to behave accordingly, while the other is left in the dust.</p>
<p>Therefore, going to a therapist is the most practical option.</p>
<p>Not only can it a safe space to say the things we want without being judged (as difficult as it is),
we can also learn how to properly talk about our emotions without referencing fiction.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is something I thought of while falling asleep, but I wanted to jot it down before I lost it.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm onto something.</p>
<p>That a guy's only reference to be emotional is to based on Hollywood, which is to cry.</p>
<p>But guys don't cry because it makes us look weak.</p>
<p>And we don't know how to properly talk about our feelings without screaming/crying/shouting/etc. because the only reference we have is films and how male characters behave when the female lead gets emotional.</p>
<p>But since we don't live in a fictional world, talking and behaving like we're in one is cringe.</p>
<p>But that's all guys know.</p>
<p>That's all everybody knows how to act.</p>
<p>But it's only socially acceptable for one gender.</p>
