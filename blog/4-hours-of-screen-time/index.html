<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to limit my phone screen time to 4 hrs.</p>
<p>I was spending a bit too much time on my phone than I would like, so I decided to give myself a limit.</p>
<h3>Why 4 hrs?</h3>
<p>I think I read in <s>a blog somewhere</s> <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/being-present/">Herman's blog</a> that the average American spends 5 1/2 hrs on their phone.</p>
<p>Me being me, I wanted to be an overachiever and go under the average.</p>
<h3>Daily phone usage</h3>
<p>I don't have any social media, accounts or apps.
So I don't spend a lot of time on them on my phone (pratically zero).
If I do, it is usually through my browser of choice <a href="https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/IronFox">IronFox</a>.</p>
<p>Most of my time is spent on <a href="https://news/ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, my RSS feed, or YouTube.
I don't necessarily mind the time I spend reading something.
Most of what I read can be lazily categorized as &quot;educational&quot;.</p>
<p>Personally, I wanted to break the habit of watching YouTube while I'm eating, which is something people my age do regularly.
I just don't think it's a good thing to do.</p>
<h3>Did it work?</h3>
<p>This is what my home screen looks like</p>
