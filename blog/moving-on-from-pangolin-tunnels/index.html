<article>
  <p>For quite a while now I've been using <a href="https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin">Pangolin Tunnels</a> on a VPS to access my homelab services.
It's been pretty solid for some months now, and it is a great FOSS alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels.
But me being me, I wanted to try out something else.</p>
<p>That something else being <a href="https://netbird.io/">Netbird</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, Netbird is a more open-source and non-VC-backed version of <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>.</p>
<p>Before Pangolin Tunnels, I was using Tailscale with a <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy reverse proxy</a> to redirect a custom domain to my homelab.
But when I saw that <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/series-c">Tailscale raised $160M</a> earlier this year, I started to look for some alternatives.
It's not because Tailscale got worse or anything, but because VC-backed stuff has a tendency to enshitify over time.</p>
<h3>NetBird any good?</h3>
<p>Honestly I couldn't tell you.
I thought latency would improve because of the mesh feature, but it's about the same as Tailscale from what I can remember.</p>
<p>But latency isn't really that important to me since all I really need from my homelab is access to my <a href="https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale">calendar &amp; contacts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/miniflux/v2">RSS reader</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sentriz/gonic">music server</a>.</p>
<p>I will say that I've been having some trouble getting the NetBird container to work with <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/quadlet-podman">Podman quadlet</a>.
I prefer using quadlets whenever I can in place of Docker.
I recently learned about <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/podman-kubernetes-secrets">podman secrets</a>, which has made me like Podman even more.
But for whatever reason I can't get it to work.</p>
<p>This is non-working quadlet:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=NetBird container
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Container]
ContainerName=netbird
Image=docker.io/netbirdio/netbird:latest
AddCapability=NET_ADMIN SYS_ADMIN SYS_RESOURCE
Network=host
Volume=%h/containers/netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird:z
Secret=nb-sk-fedora,type=env,target=NB_SETUP_KEY
AutoUpdate=registry

[Service]
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target default.target
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I'm not understanding Podman Secrets fully.
Or maybe this is another case where the container has to run with root privileges.</p>
<p>I'll fiddle with this later.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the NetBird client is running using Docker Compose:</p>
<pre><code>services:
  netbird:
      container_name: netbird
      hostname: fedora
      cap_add:
          - NET_ADMIN
          - SYS_ADMIN
          - SYS_RESOURCE
      network_mode: host
      environment:
          - NB_SETUP_KEY=&lt;SETUP-KEY&gt;
      volumes:
          - /path/to/containers/folder/netbird-client:/var/lib/netbird
      image: netbirdio/netbird:latest
      restart: always
</code></pre>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>Nothing wrong with Pangolin Tunnels, just wanted to try out Netbird + Caddy again.</p>
