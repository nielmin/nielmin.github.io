<p class="post-summary">Not as freeing as it sounds.</p>

<article>
  <p>There's been an ongoing trend about how Gen-Z ...
I've watched a lot to YouTube videos about how doomscrolling is rotting GenZ's brain and how they trying to minimize they're digital activity.</p>
<p>I haven't had any forms of social media since 2016(unless you count a YouTube account).
Yes, not even Instagram.</p>
<h2>The Reason</h2>
<p>You might asking yourself why?
Was I the rare and wise teenager that saw what social media for what it truly was and wanted no part in it?
That my younger self had the foresight not to engage with what is now a destructive part of modern society?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The reason I left social media was because I got called out by family member for my stupid political posts I was making.</p>
<p>Cause 2016 was a wild time for politics.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, this correspondence was done in a private message.
They were just fact checking all the shit I was posting and made sure I was aware of what I was saying and who I was supporting.
I was not.</p>
<p>But as any young kid would do when they're reprimanded, I vaguely replied &quot;Okay&quot; (or something i don't really remember).</p>
<p>In the following days I deleted my Facebook account, and Twitter later followed suite.</p>
<h2>So what's life like?</h2>
<p>Well, first and foremost, I don't have any friends.</p>
<p>But that's a personality problem and not an effect of not having social media.</p>
<p>Self-deprecation aside, nothing's really different.</p>
<p>Sure, I do feel a little out of the loop when my brothers talk about photos they've seen or popular memes they've shared.
So if I'm really interested in what they're talking about, I just ask them to show me the photo/meme/status post from a family member.
But outside of that, I'm not really missing much.</p>
<p>I will add that I can't really relate with people who angrily posts on social media about the state of the world.
Wars, politics, culture war, gender divide, or whatever is trending on Twitter - I find it all distasteful and a waste of energy to get worked up over.</p>
<p>But again, that could be a personality issue.</p>
<h2>What about productivity?</h2>
<p>Personally, I don't think getting rid of social media will automatically make you more productive/locked-in individual.
Getting rid of one addiction without a precise goal in mind will be replaced by another.</p>
<p>So yes, even without social media my time still gets sucked in by another vice: YouTube.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think most people's fear about getting rid of social media (and not just uninstalling it from your phone) is FOMO: Fear of Missing Out.
In some cases (like with family), this is a semi-valid fear.
But if you do miss out, there's just more to catch up with later when you eventually meet them.</p>
<p>As for keeping in touch with the current Internet culture (aka memes) and trends, it's not worth it.
The Internet is very fickle and constantly changing, and there's no reason to be up-to-date or part of it (unless it's your job).
This is especially true for Tiktok and Twitter, where everything is all meaningless, low-effort garbage.
It's better to rip that bandaid now quickly rather than letting it fester into a nasty infection.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not going to make any new social media accounts any time soon.</p>
<p>I'm quite content with current (or lack of an) internet status.</p>
