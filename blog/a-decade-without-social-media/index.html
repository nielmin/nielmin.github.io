<p class="post-summary">Not as freeing as it sounds.</p>

<article>
  <p>There's been an ongoing trend online of Gen-Z wanting to break away from social media.
Doomscrolling is rotting the brain and they trying to minimize their digital activity (by reading Cal Newport's book).</p>
<p>But getting rid of social media isn't all it's cracked up to be.</p>
<p>I would know. I deleted all social media accounts in 2016 when I was in highschool.</p>
<h2>The Reason</h2>
<p>You might asking yourself why would I do such a thing?
Was I one of those rare and wise teenager that saw what social media for what it truly was and wanted no part in it?
That my younger self had the foresight not to engage with what is now a destructive part of modern society?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The reason I left social media was because I got called out by family member for my stupid political posts I was making (cause 2016 was a wild time for politics).</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, this correspondence was done through a private message.
They were just fact checking all the shit I was posting and made sure I was aware of what I was saying and who I was supporting.</p>
<p>I was not.
I was just caught up in a &quot;culture war&quot; and vibe posting.</p>
<p>But as a dumb, all-knowing kid, I vaguely replied &quot;Okay&quot; and went about my day.</p>
<p>Then the following week, I deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts, mostly out of embarassment.</p>
<h2>So what's life like?</h2>
<p>Well, first and foremost, I don't have any friends.
But that's a personality problem and not an effect of not having social media.</p>
<p>Self-deprecation aside, <em>nothing's really different</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, I do feel a little out of the loop when my brothers talk about photos they've seen or popular memes they've shared.
So if I'm really interested, I'll just do the normal (yet simultaneously awkard) action of asking them to show me.</p>
<p>But outside of that, I'm not <em>that</em> different of a person.</p>
<p>I will add that I can't really relate with people who angrily posts on social media about the state of the world.
Wars, politics, culture war, gender divide, or whatever is trending on Twitter - I find it all distasteful and a waste of energy to get worked up over.</p>
<p>But again, that could be a personality issue.</p>
<h2>What about productivity?</h2>
<p>I don't think getting rid of social media will automatically make you a more productive/locked-in individual.
Getting rid of one addiction without a precise goal in mind will be replaced by another.</p>
<p>So yes, even without social media my time still gets sucked in by videogames and YouTube.</p>
<h2>FOMO</h2>
<p>When it comes to getting rid of social media (and not just uninstalling the app from your phone), I think most people worry about is FOMO: the Fear of Missing Out.</p>
<p>In some cases (like with family), this is a semi-valid fear.
What if you miss a Facebook post about someone's engagement or new baby?
If these events are important to you to be current with, then continue to use Facebook.</p>
<p>But the way I see it, if you do miss out, then there's just more to catch up and talk about when you eventually meet them for the holidays.</p>
<p>Live in the moment and all that.</p>
<p>As for keeping in touch with the current Internet culture (aka memes) and trends, it's not worth it.
The Internet is a very fickle place, and there's no reason to be up-to-date about it (unless it's part of your job).
This is especially true for Tiktok and Twitter, where everything is all meaningless, low-effort garbage.
It's better to rip that bandaid now rather than letting it fester into a nasty infection.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So no, I'm not the person everyone thinks they'll be when they get rid of social media.
I'm not ultra productive or highly successful or &quot;happy&quot; (whatever that means).</p>
<p>But I'm also not miserable (or if I am it's of my own accord).
I don't spend my waking hours worrying about things influencers tell me to worry about or things I can't control.</p>
<p>Life's not perfect, but not having something that'll make it more of a mess is a blessing.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not going to make any new social media accounts any time soon.</p>
<p>P.S. I forgot I had a Discord account, which goes to show how little I give a shit about it.</p>
